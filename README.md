**Found this page via Google and looking for the vanilla pack?** www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1223254

**Description:**

Faithful 32 with mod support: All textures done to match original style.

The original pack is made by Vattic and a long list of helpers. Please look under the Credits section of his forum post I linked above.

This repository is a complete resource pack, you do not need to add this to vanilla Faithful 32.

**License:**

Not all works are original, many of them are re-hosted or folder moved to maintain compatibility. 
By extension this means both myself(DZCreeper) and anyone that re-hosts this pack or derivative works may not profit from distribution.
That means there is no restriction on re-hosting or derivative work. Please only re-host if the site is down to avoid distributing outdated versions.
