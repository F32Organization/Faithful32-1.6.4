Faithful32-1.6.4 Modded Edition
================

**Found this page via Google and looking for the** [vanilla pack](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1223254)?

**Description:**

Faithful 32 with mod support: All textures done to match original style.

The original pack is made by Vattic and a long list of helpers. Please look under the Credits section of his forum post I linked above.

This repository is a complete resource pack, you do not need to add this to vanilla Faithful 32.

**License:**

Not all work is original, some textures are re-hosted or moved to maintain compatibility. 
By extension this means both myself(DZCreeper) and anyone that re-hosts this pack or derivative works may not profit from distribution to ensure reasonable upstream licensing compliance.
That means there is no restriction on re-hosting or derivative work. Please only re-host if the site is down to avoid distributing outdated versions.


**Downloading and Usage:**

1) Download the latest pack from this [site](http://f32.me/).

2) Run Minecraft, select "Options...", select "Resource Packs", select "Open resource pack folder".

3) Drag and drop the zip file into the resource pack folder.

4) Go back to Minecraft and select the Faithful pack and you are done.
