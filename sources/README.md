Files in this folder are either in .pdn format which are Paint.Net source files or .psd which are Photoshop files. 

These files contain source images and methods for created textures when supplied; Supplying source files for work is appreciated, not required.

Folder layout should match the layout of the non-source versions when possible.

Submitting work in progress to this folder is allowed, this way two strangers can work together on a sub-project if they wish.
